                       <h2>21. Additional Terms for Specific Services</h2><br><br>
                       <p>Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific Services.

                       <p>These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and Bini, and supersede any prior agreements. These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights. If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent. These Terms were written in English and to the extent the translated version of these Terms conflict with the English version, the English version will control.</p><br><br>
